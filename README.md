# Project Overview
We are developing NomNom is an intuitive, simple, Japanese design inspired recipe website application. 
We aim to provide users with an extensive collection of recipes, incorporate user-friendly design 
and categorization. All of this to solve the problem of cluttered, ad-heavy websites.

# Git Workflow
We use a structured Git workflow to track progress and collaborate effectively:
- `main` – stable, production-ready version
- `dev` – in-progress, integration branch
- `feature/x` – individual features
- `bugfix/x` – issue-specific fixes
  
# GitHub Usage plan
- Feature development is done via `feature/*` branches and merged into `dev` via **Pull Requests**.
- All Pull Requests are reviewed by at least one team member before merging.
